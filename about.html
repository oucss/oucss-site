    <h2>Our Origins</h2>
    <p>
      The Open University Cyber Security Society (OUCSS) began as a Facebook group on 
      <strong>21st September 2018</strong>, before expanding to a Discord community on 
      <strong>20th July 2019</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded by students of <strong>The Open University</strong>, the society became an 
      official university club on <strong>6th October 2020</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      OUCSS is an active and growing community of students from a wide range of disciplines.
      Many members study:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>R60 – BSc (Honours) Cyber Security</li>
      <li>Q62 – BSc (Honours) Computing and IT</li>
      <li>Other STEM-based qualifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, students from <strong>any Open University course</strong> are welcome to join.
      Our Discord server is where the majority of our collaboration, mentoring, and discussion takes place.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We focus on improving practical skills, discussing technical concepts, and networking
      with like-minded individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many members actively train on platforms such as <strong>TryHackMe</strong> and 
      <strong>Hack The Box</strong>, often competing under the InfOUsec team banner.
    </p>

    <p>
      We regularly participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions — collaborative events
      that challenge participants in web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography,
      forensics, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      No prior knowledge is required. Whether you are just starting or already experienced,
      OUCSS provides an environment to learn and grow.
    </p>

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>
      While learning is our core focus, we also maintain dedicated channels for games,
      general chat, and social interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're interested in cybersecurity and want to connect with fellow students,
      we encourage you to join us.
